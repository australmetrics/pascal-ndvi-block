# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language  
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
* Focusing on what is best for the community  
* Showing empathy towards other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery  
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
